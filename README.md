# Neural tube patterning: from a minimal model for rostrocaudal patterning towards an integrated 3D model

Repository containing the code used in the paper "Neural tube patterning: from a minimal model for rostrocaudal patterning towards an integrated 3D model"
by M. Brambach et al. (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.02.323535).

The repository is structured into the code for the rostrocaudal model (`/rostrocaudal`) and for the 3D model (`/3D`).
